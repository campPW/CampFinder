# CampFinder #

Python modules to aid in finding reservable campsites at Recreation.gov facilities. 

**Getting Started**

The Selenium bindings for python and the driver for the browser must be installed before using the CampScanner module (default browser is Firefox). Instructions can be found [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#downloading-python-bindings-for-selenium).

BeautifulSoup4 must also be installed. See instructions [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

If using the FacilityIDsFinder module you will need an RIDB API key. You must create a Recreation.gov account (sign up [here](https://www.recreation.gov/sign-up)). After creating an account, go to https://ridb.recreation.gov/ and sign in and navigate to your profile to generate an api key. 


See example.py to get something working immediately.
